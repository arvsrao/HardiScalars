- Document in INSTALL.txt what is required to use the tools in this package (Runtime Requirements).
  For example, state the version of MAPLE used for the scripts, MATLAB.

- Document purpose and usage of each script and executable either within the source file
  itself (in the file header at the top), or in the documentation .rst files.
  
  In case of MATLAB scripts/functions, it might be reasonable to have a documentation of
  the input arguments within the MATLAB help comment at the top of the file.

- Add some example input data to example/ and include in the description of the tools
  how to call them with this input data and what the expected output is.

- Make clear in the documentation if a script has to be modified before use as it contains
  fixed file paths and that it does not process any input arguments (if that is the case).
  The reader must be aware that the tool cannot be used as is.

- Eventually, most scripts should be modified to accept input arguments such as paths
  to the input data, output directory,... and help/usage output in order to make them
  more generally useful.

- Replace use of SbiaUtils functions of the SBIA Toolkit in Python scripts by the
  corresponding functions of the BASIS utilities for Python.

- What is it about the file test/spherePointsFiveHundred ? How to use it ?

- What does the file example/Bmat.h contain ? What would I want to use it for ? It doesn't
  seem to be used by any example program. Please document on top of this file.


- Are the spherePoints*.h header files commonly/widely used in this field ? Do they
  have value for others to make use of these data files ? If yes, they might be also
  well placed in include/sbia/hardiscalars/. E.g., there would be only one
  include/sbia/hardiscalars/sphere1000points.h file, instead of three copies in
  example/, src/tools/, and test/...
